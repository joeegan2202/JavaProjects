# Joe's Java Projects

All of these projects were dug out of an old hard drive.
I tried to get some of them to work in my current setup, but I couldn't get libraries imported, and they primarily use an older version of a library, and I just don't care that much.
It is a demonstration of my Java related activity in the past.
